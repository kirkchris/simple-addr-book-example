simple-addr-book-example
========================

During college (a few years back) I was required to create a simple web app in 24 hours, so I made this PHP/MySQL based address book example.

There were a couple of requests, such as use Javascript to code a smart search bar that would give suggestions based on what you wrote. Obviously, this is the standard now, but it wasn't everywhere when I wrote this. 
I was also required to include a sitemap.
